# Changes to unix-privesc-check in Version 2 #

The SVN tag "r2\_0" onwards (and trunk) contain a completely new codebase for unix-privesc-check.

It is modular and coded much more cleanly.  It contains a significant number of checks that were not present in v1 of the codebase.

# Which Version Should I Use? #

Until version 2 has been debugged and stabilised, you should probably use both versions.

Version 2 will perform some extra checks.  It is also more regularly maintained.

Version 1 contains some checks that have not been ported across.  It is more mature and stable.
